Specially, we developed one unified data matrix as inputs for all tools. This type of input data could be easily prepared using Excel or other text-editors or simple programs. Once uploaded, the data file could be easily loaded to each tool to generate various displaying. This makes EVenn a more suitable tool for exploratory analysis and to choose the best way to explain and visualize data. In order to compute the significance of the overlap between two groups of elements which could be genes or OTUs, random sample test and Jaccard similarity test were applied. The tool Venn calculator could generate the counts and detailed elements for each non-empty intersection for datasets with any number of groups. The results could be used for downstream selection and also could be used as input for data visualization using EVenn. Evenn is available at http://www.ehbio.com/test/venn/. We also recorded a video showing how to generate 5 types of Venn diagrams in less than 3 minutes (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CK4y1P7Gi). 0.1 Demo data and animations Each tool contains at least one copy of demo data for beginners. Normally only one click on the Submit button is needed to generate the demo result. Pictures and animations illustrating the usages of every tools step by step are recorded in following sections. Left arrow key and right arrow key in the keyboard could be used to navigate this document to change sections. Some example data are also listed in the second section - Example files. 0.2 Hints for question mark symbol This may be a common sense that question mark symbol (?) hides help information. Figure 0.1: Hovering the mouse cursor on any question mark symbol to see help or description information. 0.3 Gallary 0.3.1 Venn network for OTUs Figure 0.2: Venn network using demo data Click https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CK4y1P7Gi?p=2 to view the tutorials. 0.3.2 Venn network for DE genes Figure 0.3: Venn network using data &lt;DE_gene_file.txt&gt; in example data. 0.3.3 Venn network for pathway enrichment results Figure 0.4: Venn network using data &lt;DE_gene_file.txt&gt; in example data. 0.3.4 Venn network for 12 sets Figure 0.5: Venn network using data &lt;DE_gene_file.txt&gt; in example data. 0.4 How to cite? EVenn is constructed since 2018 and is initially treated as a sub-tool of ImageGP (a free online plotting platform) with accessing address as www.ehbio.com/ImageGP/index.php/Home/Index/VennDiagram.html and has been cited directly for at least 16 times (according to google scholar). In year 2021 we remodeled EVenn as an independent tool (http://www.ehbio.com/test/venn) to support more functions with much clearer user interface. In last month, there are 2,749 unique visitors for new EVenn with different IP (Internet Protocol Address) from China, American and Europe. Everyday there are about 100 visitors. Currently there are 3 citations for new EVenn. Normally they would use Venn diagrams were generated using EVenn (http://www.ehbio.com/test/venn). as the citation sentences. "],
["inputfileformat.html", "1 Input file format 1.1 The unified two-column matrix for all tools 1.2 Specifialized input formats for some tools", " 1 Input file format 1.1 The unified two-column matrix for all tools In EVenn, we unified the input data in one simple format for all tools. It is a two-column regular matrix with: The first column containing elements by rows. And the second column specifies the set each item belongs to, so we named it as two-column mode (Fig 1.1 A-D). If one item belongs to several sets, it may appear in several rows. The order of rows does not matter. The order of columns matters at least for interactive Venn diagrams and Venn networks. This type of data could be easily generated using Excel or other text-editors with just ‘copy-paste’ operations. It could also be generated program-ably in any analysis pipeline with addition or changing only few codes. Another advantage of this specified format is that it is both human and machine readable, and could be saved for repeatable usages. Based on the unified input format, it is feasible to generate and compare different visualization ways during the data exploring stage and result showing stage. Leaving out of the trouble of file format changing for separate tools, which is essential and not so trivial for researchers who could not program. Figure 1.1: Illustration of input data formats. A. The general example of two-column data matrix. B, C, and D represent specified examples for gene sets, OTUs sets and pathway sets respectively. E. Pasting elements for each set separately. F. Typing counts for each intersection. G. Binary matrix format. 1.2 Specifialized input formats for some tools Besides, the classical input formats for each tool were also preserved for meeting various requirements. For example: Pasting elements for each set separately and naming each set on the fly for interactive Venn diagram (Fig 1.1 E). Input the counts instead of related elements of each intersections to draw interactive Venn diagrams and Euler diagrams (Fig 1.1 F). This is useful for counting data such as cell immunofluorescence experiments how many cells are stained as red, how many cells are stained as green, how many cells have merged color of yellow. UpSet also supports a binary matrix for illustrating elements existence (Fig 1.1 G). In this format, the first line is the header line containing names of all sets. Each row represents one element. Each column represents each set. Each row represents one element. A value of non-zero representing the corresponding element belongs to the corresponding set. "],

Through clicking figures in generated plots, one could easily get elements lists for each intersection part. This would facilitate screening candidate elements like genes or OTUs meeting specified intersection patterns. Besides, it has several functions like switching between standard Venn layout and Edwards-Venn layout, switch on and off different lists for comparing. Another useful improvement compared with Jvenn is that one can reorder each set to get better visualization by simple dragging of input text-areas. This function is especially useful when one wants to delete one or several sets, no need of re-input for already existed sets (Fig 3.4). There are also parameters for changing font sizes, font families, sets colors and other displaying attributes. 3.1 Three types of input ways Three types of input ways are supported for more feasible usages, * uploading or pasting all data together using two-column formats (Two-column mode, which is the default) ((Fig 1.1 A) and Fig 3.1 1), * directly pasting elements of each set (Input elements) ((Fig 1.1 E) and Fig 3.1 2), * typing in counts of each intersections (Input numbers) ((Fig 1.1 F) and Fig 3.1 3).

The result picture could be exported in the scalable vector graphics (SVG) format which could be converted to high-resolution images or combined with other pictures for publication usages. Elements lists for each intersection could be downloaded in table format. 3.2 Pasting two-column mode data matrix Here we use an animation showing the simple steps of generating and exploring an interactive Venn diagram with pasted two-column matrix (Fig 3.2). Figure 3.2: Animation illustrating the steps of generating interactive venn diagrams with pasted data matrix. We split these steps separately. Paste your data matrix in two-column mode to the text-area (Fig 3.3 1 step). Select which set to be analyzed in order. Unique value of the second column (including the header line if existed) would be saved in the drop-down menu as set names for selection (Fig 3.3 2 step). After several selection, we could get one Venn diagram showing left-top. Set order could also be changed by holding on button (Fig 3.3 3) and dragging to the target position. color of each set could be customized separately using the color-picker beside set names (Fig 3.3 4). Global configuration parameters could be switched on by clicking button (Fig 3.3 5), including display mode, font family, font size, statistics based on input lists (number of elements for each set), switch button, intersection counts. One could easily check their functions if not clearly described by simple clicking. Venn diagrams in PNG, SVG format and intersection elements in CSV lists could be downloaded by clicking button (Fig 3.3 6). In CSV lists, one column represents one type of non-empty intersections and attached elements. Click the count number in the Venn diagram would show the elements belonging to this intersection in below text-area with one headline showing elements’ belonging. Figure 3.3: Displaying the steps for generating interactive venn diagrams with pasted data matrix in two-column mode. 3.3 Use the uploaded two-column mode data matrix Here we use an animation showing how to choose the uploaded data matrix (seeing section 2 for data uploading), selecting sets, removing sets, reordering sets and other operations for 6 sets (Fig 3.4). Figure 3.4: An animation illustrating the steps of generating interactive venn diagrams with previously uploaded data matrix. 3.4 Pasting elements of each set Most online Venn diagram tools use this kind of input, pasting elements for each set separately and name each set on the fly. 3.5 Input numbers for each intersection This is sometimes useful for drawing Venn diagrams without elements but only numbers, such as the counting results of cell immunofluorescence experiments: how many cells are stained as red, how many cells are stained as green, how many cells have merged color of yellow.

Theoretically, it could have better visualization effects for more sets than Venn diagrams. And it could clearly show the fully-containing-relationships among 2 or several sets (Fig 4.1). In EVenn, Euler diagram generates area-proportional diagrams, in which the sizes of intersection areas positively correlated with number of intersection elements. This gives more perceptual intuition than only showing numbers. Figure 4.1: Illustration of fully contained sets using the Euler diagram. 4.1 Two types of input ways Euler diagram supports two types of input. One is the two-column mode format matrix as we described above (Fig 1.1 A). The other is a count matrix also with two columns (Fig 1.1 F). The first line would be treated as the header line. The first column containing intersection parts of all sets by rows and the second column containing the number of elements in each intersection part. The &amp; symbol in the first column represents intersecting. The column separator should be one TAB. 4.2 Pasting two-column mode data matrix Here we use an animation showing the simple steps of generating the Euler diagram with pasted two-column matrix (Fig 4.2). Figure 4.2: Animation illustrating the steps of generating Euler diagrams with pasted data matrix. We split these steps separately. Select one and only one data format (Fig 4.3 1 and 1 radio button). Supposing we select Two-column mode matrix. Paste your data matrix in two-column mode to the text-area (Fig 4.3 3) or select one uploaded file (Fig 4.3 4) (See section 2 for data uploading.). We assume the first column contains elements and the second column contains sets name and will automatically get the names of each column to fill in (Fig 4.3 5 and 6). If your data matrix does not follow this assumption, one are allowed to change values of these two drop-down selection boxes.

Enlarge these numbers if the graphic displaying is incomplete. Most parameters could be selected very easily. Here we only explain the color setting parameters. Here we supplied two ways to defined colors: Manual color for each set and Manual color vector (color set). Manual color for each set: Set the color of each set. Remember to click OK when color is designated in color pickers (Fig 4.5 and Fig 4.6). This parameter is mutual exclusion with Manual color vector (color set) parameter. Please first clear values of Manual color vector (color set) to make this parameter able. If you want to assign color for each set, same number of colors should be picked. If the number of picked colors less than number of sets, the program would generate intermediate colors to make they equal. Manual color vector (color set): Select the color vector for all sets. This parameter is mutual exclusion with Manual color for each set parameter. Please first clear values of Manual color for each set parameter to make this parameter able. Attention: In each way, the number of color is not needed to be the same as number of sets. The underlying program will try the best to deal with color assignments.

The bars are normally ordered by item counts, giving more direct decision of the largest sets and intersections. Intersections which are empty could be selectively hided to save space for visualizing much more sets. Figure 5.1: UpSet diagrams for 5 sets. Horizontal blue bars represent total number of elements of each set. Orange bars represent number of elements of each intersection indicated by connected dots.

Each set would be treated as one parent node, each item would be connected to its parent nodes via edges. Elements connected with all sets are shared among them. Interactive venn network is implemented using vis.js with function extensions and simplified steps. Figure 7.1: Venn network for 3 sets. The three light-blue nodes represent sets KO, OE and WT. The purple nodes in the middle are shared among 3 sets. Those nodes connected with two edges are shared by every two sets.

New nodes and edges could be added by two buttons: Add node and Add edge (Fig 7.3 5). Multiple nodes could be selected using one of the following three methods. Hold down CTRL on the keyboard and click nodes to be selected; Hold down each candidate node for more than one second to select multiple nodes; Draw a cursor rectangle with the Right Mouse button hold down to select multiple nodes. When multiple nodes were selected, their attributes (label font-size, size, shape, border width, background color, nodes border color, label color) could be changed in batch using the Edit X-nodes (Fig 7.3 3) button. Nodes and edges styles could also be changed on nodes and edges menus in the left-side tool-bar. The overall layout could be changed using hieratical and physics menus in the left-side toolbar (Fig 7.3 6,7,8,9,10). Additionally, clicking Cyclization button (Fig 7.3 4) will make all selected nodes form a circle. 7.4 Color setting for Venn network Each set should have one and only one color assignment. Please see Fig 4.6 for operation showing. 7.5 Venn network showing gene ontology/KEGG enrichment informations In microbiome analysis, interpretation function impacting of genes with differential abundance among experimental groups is one major goal. Normally genes are associated with multiple gene ontology (GO) annotations or pathways. The using of bar-plot or dot-plot to show GO analysis results though simple but may loss information of GO relationships such as the percentage of genes shared by different categories. Venn network could show both ontologies and their relationships through common connected genes. This is also suitable for transcriptome, genome and other omics-data analysis.

Each function was split into separate tabs for fast access and with one demo data for quick starting. Users are allowed to set font family, font size, area colors, area shapes, line types, image width, image height, set order for one or several modules to generate publication-quality outputs. Each module also has some special parameters for flexible usages. 10.2 Implementation EVenn is implemented as a web application using Javascript and HTML for frontend development. The used core Javascript libraries include Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/), jvenn.js (http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html) and vis.js (https://visjs.org). High-level Python web framework Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/) is used for backend data preprocess and data analysis. Euler diagram is generated based on R package Eulerr. Upsetview plot is generated based on R package UpSetR. Statistical significance of set similarity is computed using in house python programs (random sample test) and R scripts based on R package jaccard (jaccard similarity test). Item lists and item counts for each intersection region are computed using in house python scripts. 10.3 The unified input format of data matrix Different tools read in different types of data, which forces users to do tedious work of data format transferring. It gives more burden as datasets increasing, especially for scientists lack of programming skills. Most venn tools require users to supply each set separately or irregular data matrix (each column has different number of rows). Both formats are not suitable for people saving or program generating. Here we unified Input data in one simple format for all tools. It is a two-column regular matrix with the first column containing items by rows and the second column specifies the set each item belongs to, so we named it as “two-column mode” (Fig 1). If one item belongs to several sets, it may appear in several rows. The order of rows does not matter. The order of columns matters at least for interactive venn diagrams. This type of data could be easily generated using Excel or other text-editors with just ‘copy-paste’ operations. It could also be generated program-ably in any analysis pipeline with addition or changing only few codes. Another advantage of this specified format is that it is both human and machine readable, and could be saved for repeatable usages. Based on the unified input format, it is feasible to generate and compare different visualization ways during the data exploring stage and result showing stage. Leaving out of the trouble of file format changing for separate tools, which is essential and not so trivial for researchers who could not program. Besides, the classical input formats for each tool were also preserved for meeting various requirements. For example, one could only input the number of each intersections instead of related items to draw interactive venn diagrams and euler diagrams. This is useful for counting data such as cell immunofluorescence experiments how many cells are stained as red, how many cells are stained as green, how many cells have merged color of blue. Also, one could paste items for each set separately and naming each set on the fly. This requires several times of copy-pasting and the data could not be easily saved for future usages. 10.4 Interactive venn diagrams This module is implemented mainly based on the jvenn JavaScript library with some extensions. The interactive attribute of this module supports to get items of each intersection part by clicking numbers in the picture. This interactivity makes venn diagrams not only pictures showing the relationships among sets, but also analysis tools that would facilitate identifying candidate items like genes or OTUs. A bar plot showing number of all sets would be shown by default to check their homogeneity. Besides, it has several advantages like switching between standard venn layout and Edwards-Venn layout, switch on and off different lists. The result picture could be exported in scalable vector graphics (SVG) format which could be converted to high-resolution images or combined with other pictures for publication usages. Four types of input ways are supported for more feasible usages, directly pasting items of each set (Input items), typing in counts of each intersections (Input numbers), uploading the data file (Upload file) and pasting all data together using two-column formats (Two-column mode). For Upload file and Two-column mode, users are allowed to select which set to be used and their appearance order, allowing inputting data with more than 6 sets. Another useful improvement is that one can reordering each set to get better visualization by simple dragging of input text-areas. This function is especially useful when one wants to delete one or several sets, no need of re-input for already pasted sets. 10.5 Venn diagram like plots: Euler diagram plot, Upset view plot, Flower plot As the increasing of data complexity, classical venn diagrams may not always meet the best requirement for data visualization. There are several other types of plots to display set relationships. Euler diagram plots do not display empty intersection regions, giving more concrete and accuracy visualization. Theoretically, it could have better visualization effects for more sets than venn diagrams. And it could clearly show the fully-containing-relationships among 2 or several sets. In Evenn, Euler diagram plot function generate proportional euler diagrams, in which the sizes of sets and intersection areas are positively correlated with number of items in them. This gives more perceptual intuition than the numbers in venn diagrams. Euler diagram function accepts two types of input formats (Counts and Items (in two-column mode)). Column order does not matter in this tool since there is a radio combo to specify which column contains items information and which column contains sets information. Several other visual styles like number types, plot shapes, font size, line type and colors could be customized as required. The result picture could be downloaded in PDF format for publication usages. Upset view is designed as a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets and their intersections. It composed three parts, a horizontal bar-plot showing total number of items of each set, a dot-plot indicating all types of intersections among sets, a vertical bar-plot representing number of items of corresponding intersections. The bars are normally orders by item counts, giving more direct decision of the largest sets and intersections. Intersections which are empty or containing few items could be selectively hided to save space for visualizing much more sets. For integrated data with more than 10 or 20 sets, neither venn diagram, euler diagram or upset view (when most intersections are not empty) would give reasonable displaying. Flower plot which shows only common items shared by all sets and special items for each set provides another choice. This is a trade-off between ease-interpretation and information loss. Flower plot would be more useful when displaying commonality or specificity, while other intersection combinations are not so important. 10.6 Venn network exploring intersections Normally venn diagrams and their variants only show the counts or percentages of all intersections instead of items. We present Venn network, which could show both items and their belonging sets in an interactive network diagram. Each set would be treated as one parent node, each item would be connected to its parent node via edges. Items connected with all sets are shared among them. We present a button called “Preferred layout” would usually give the optimized layout to clearly display the intersection relationships of sets after 1-2 minutes computation. Items of each intersection were clustered together and got away from other intersections. Targeting items could be searched and highlighted with connected sets to show its belongings. Several hotkeys and the detail toolbar were added for modifying layouts, nodes and edges attributes to generate publication-quality pictures to be downloaded in SVG format. 10.7 Tools for estimating sets similarity and calculating sets intersections Visualization would give qualitative but not quantitative estimation of sets similarity. However it is normally needed to check the significance level of sets similarity to get more conclusive interpretations. We implied two commonly used methods: random sample test and Jaccard similarity test. Random sample test using random sampling process for 1000 times to check if given overlaps are random or not. Jaccard similarity test using the Jaccard similarity coefficient – the ratio of intersection to union for statistical testing of similarity between binary data. There are also scenes that we want to quickly select candidate items like genes or OTUs for downstream analysis before generating plots. Venn calculator is designed to output items for intersections for any number of sets in table format for further exploring. Besides, the output could be easily given to Euler diagram to generate plots without computing again. "]
